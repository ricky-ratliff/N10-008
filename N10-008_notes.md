# Domain 1.0 Networking Fundamentals Study Notes

## Topic 1A: Compare and Contrast OSI Model Layers

**Exam Objectives Covered**

*1.1 Compare and contrast the OSI model layers and encapsulation concepts*

- Networks are built on common standards and models that describe how devices and protocols interconnect
- The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model breaks the data communication process into discrete layers
- Being able to identify OSI layers and compare the functions of devices and protocols working at teach layer will help you to implement and troubleshoot networks

## OSI Model

- Network: two or more computer systems that are linked by a transmission medium and share one or more protocols that enable them to exchange data
  - nodes and links
  - Nodes send, receive, and forward data
  - Links are the pathways between them
- Developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)

## Data Encapsulation And Decapsulation

- Network protocol: set of rules for excanging data in a structured format

### Terms & Concepts To Review

- [ ] flow control
- [ ] active/passive tap
- [ ] CSMA/CD preamble
- [ ] max cable distances
